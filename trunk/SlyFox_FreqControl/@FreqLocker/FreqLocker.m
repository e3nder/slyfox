    %FREQLOCKER Rabi Spectroscopy locking program
    %   This program is intended to be used in conjunction with the
    %   freqsweeper program and is meant to be used to lock to Rabi
    %   lineshapes for use in atomic clock experiments, or to carefully
    %   cancel drifts between shots. This program should have a few
    %   different modes once it is done. Single-peak locking, Stretched
    %   State locking, and intermittent locking mode for canceling drifts
    %   between experiments. Written by Ben Bloom. Last Updated 01/22/12
